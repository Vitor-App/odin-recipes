        <p>An easy lasagna recipe that saves me lots of time. This dish satisfies everyone in the family. Try it tonight!</p>

    <h2><strong><em>Ingredients</em></strong></h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong> This easy lasagna starts with ground beef. You can use ground turkey for a lighter option.</li>
          <li><strong>Spaghetti sauce:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade spaghetti sauce.</li>
            <li><strong>Cheeses:</strong> You’ll need cottage cheese, mozzarella, and Parmesan. </li>
              <li><strong>Eggs:</strong> Eggs help bind the cheese mixture together. Plus, they lend moisture and richness.</li>
                <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> Season the easy lasagna with dried parsley, salt, and black pepper.</li>
                  <li><strong>Lasagna noodles:</strong> Of course, you’ll need lasagna noodles!</li>
                    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Pour ½ cup of water around the edges of the baking dish before baking.</li>
      </ul>

     <h2><strong><em>Steps</em></strong></h2>
       <ol>
         <li><strong>Step one:</strong> Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). </li>
           <li><strong>Step two:</strong> Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir ground beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 8 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard grease. Stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 5 minutes.</li>
             <li><strong>Step three:</strong> Combine cottage cheese, 2 cups of mozzarella cheese, eggs, 1/2 of the grated Parmesan cheese, dried parsley, salt, and pepper in a large bowl.</li>
               <li><strong>Step four:</strong> Spread 3/4 cup of sauce in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Cover with 3 uncooked lasagna noodles, 1 3/4 cups of cheese mixture, and 1/4 cup sauce; repeat layers once more. Top with remaining 3 noodles, sauce, mozzarella, and Parmesan cheese. Pour 1/2 cup water along the edges of the dish. Cover tightly with aluminum foil.</li>
                 <li><strong>Step Five:</strong> Bake in the preheated oven for 45 minutes. Uncover and bake for an additional 10 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes before serving.</li>
